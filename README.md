### Structure of a README File

    ```

**11. Additional Sections**

**Markdown Syntax in READMEs**

- **Headers** are created with `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.
- **Bold** text is indicated with double asterisks: **like this**.
- *Italic* text uses single asterisks: *like this*.
- Lists can be either numbered like `1. First item` or bulleted like `- First item`.
- Code is usually indicated by backticks for inline (`like this`) or triple backticks for blocks:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
- Links are indicated by square brackets and parentheses: `[link text](http://example.com)`.
- Images are similar to links but start with `!` and end with the image's file name: `![Alt Text](image-file.png)`

**Best Practices**
- Keep your text clear and concise.
- Use images and diagrams when they can explain something better than words.
- Update your `README` regularly to reflect changes in your project.
